Package for Parallel Programming Courses
-----

A stripped down MinGW based distribution of the gcc compiler and related libraries. The purpose of this package is to provide a self-contained Windows distribution for practical teaching of parallel programing. A series of basic examples of using various programming APIs is included.

Package contains the following:
	ToolChain:
		- binutils 2.20.51 (MinGW)
		- mingwrt 3.18 (MinGW)
		- gcc-core 4.5.0-1 (MinGW)
			- gcc-c++ 4.5.0-1 (MinGW)
			- gmp 5.0.1 (MinGW)
			- gomp 4.5.0-1 (MinGW)
			- mpc 0.8.1-1 (MinGW)
			- mpfr 2.4.1-1 (MinGW)
			- pthread 2.8.0-3 (MinGW)
			- ssp 4.5.0-1 (MinGW)
		- make 3.82-3 (MinGW) With a "make" wrapper command for mingw32-make
		- gdb 7.2-1 (MinGW)
			- libexpat 2.0.2 (MinGW)
		- git-core 1.7.2.3 (msysgit) cut down to work with http only (no opensh)
		- w32api 3.15-1 (MinGW)
		- freeglut 2.6.0
		- glew 1.5.6
		- mpich2 1.4.1p1 incl. runtime dependencies (smpd)
		- Intel OpenCL SDK 1.5 (without docs and examples)
	Applications:
		- CodeBlocks
		- SciTE
	Examples:
	  Some examples were adopted from Mats Aspn√§s parallel programming courses 2011
